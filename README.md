## My mindset
Is Democracy more than a vote? Does not everyone seek a more reliable, free and secure future? Lets achieve it together. Tomorrow's world will be decentralized, more flexible and less conservative. Lets enjoy 100% remote work with superb financial and social rewards. Tackling climate change and the upcoming, connected catastrophic events. Countering side-effects of our ancestor's technological development by continuing our own development and freedom, implementing the best solutions. Ethics help us to distinguish right and wrong, giving us lead. Lead makes us smart, thus strong. We seek freedom and defeat oppression, while keeping our own interests in sight. We always look into each others' eyes, never down on others. We respect, serve, protect, help and defend each other! Never back down. United we stand, united we thrive.
