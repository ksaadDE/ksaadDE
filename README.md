## Preferences or Opinions?
Is Democracy more than a vote? A more reliable, free and secure future? We will achieve it - together. Tomorrow's world will be decentralized, more flexible and less conservative. I prefer to work 100% remotely and for huge financial and social rewards. Let's tackle climate change and the upcoming, connected catastrophic events. We will find and implement working solutions to counter side-effects of our ancestor's technological development, while continuing and expanding our own development and freedom. Ethics have a deep meaning for me. Strict moral and logical guidelines are helping to decide what's right and what's wrong. Lead makes justified decisions and implementing them easier. Lets seek freedom and defeat oppression, with respect for our own interests. Never looking down on others. Always looking in each other's eyes. Reaching out, helping out, protecting, serving and working together! Together we stand, united we are.
